This is the README for SOGui, a window and widget interface for SDL and Opengl using FBOs

Project files supplied are Code::Blocks for MinGW on Windows

Current dependencies:
SDL
OpenGL

So far there is only a concept project, in which I will build & test ideas before formulating a best way forward. This could be either like Boost (put everything into .hpp header files) or some other way (friend drawing methods, functors, inheritence).
